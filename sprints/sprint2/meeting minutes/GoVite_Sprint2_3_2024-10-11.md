**Executive summary**  
In this meeting, we delved into the three essential layers crucial for the ongoing development of our peer assessment application: the database, backend, and frontend. Recognizing the importance of a structured approach, we designated one team member to focus on adding new features to the database. This strategic move aims to ensure that our backend can effectively support the evolving needs of the application as we implement new features in upcoming sprints. Additionally, we emphasized the critical need for developing API functions to facilitate seamless communication between the frontend and backend. This will significantly enhance user experience, allowing for smooth data retrieval and submission while improving overall application performance. As we track our progress, we remain committed to continuously improving our processes and designs to better align with project goals. This will help us proactively address any challenges as they arise and adapt to new requirements effectively.

1. Three Layers of Development  
   We identified the essential layers for our projectâ€”database, backend, and frontend. Each layer plays a critical role in the overall architecture and functionality of the application. The database serves as the backbone for data storage and retrieval, while the backend processes requests and implements business logic. The frontend provides an interface for users, making it vital to ensure that all layers work harmoniously together. This layered approach will help us maintain a comprehensive and organized development process, leading to more efficient project execution.  
     
2. Database Management  
   To enhance our database management, we appointed one team member to take charge of adding new features. This decision is aimed at streamlining updates and enhancements, allowing for a more efficient workflow. By having a dedicated individual focus on this area, we can ensure that our data management practices remain robust and responsive to the evolving project requirements, especially as we look to implement user authentication and team management functionalities.  
     
3. API Development  
   We discussed the necessity of developing API functions that support frontend requests. By facilitating seamless interaction between the frontend and backend components, these APIs will significantly enhance user experience. They will enable smooth data retrieval and submission, ultimately improving overall application performance. This will also set the stage for implementing new features in subsequent sprints, such as the basic peer assessment interface and evaluation submission system.  
     
4. Progress Tracking and Improvement  
   Our commitment to tracking progress regularly was emphasized during the meeting. This practice will help us identify areas for improvement and adapt our processes and designs to better meet project goals. By establishing a system of regular check-ins and updates, we can proactively address challenges that arise and make informed decisions regarding the direction of the project. As we move forward, this approach will contribute to the overall success of the application.  
     
5. Design Review and Iteration  
   We highlighted the importance of conducting regular design reviews and iterations. These sessions will allow us to assess our current design choices, gather valuable feedback from team members, and make necessary adjustments to ensure that our application meets user needs and expectations effectively. This iterative process will foster innovation and improve the overall usability of the peer assessment application.
