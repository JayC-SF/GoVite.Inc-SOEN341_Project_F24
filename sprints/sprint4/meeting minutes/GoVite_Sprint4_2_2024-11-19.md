**Executive summary**

In this meeting, we reviewed the progress made so far in Sprint 4 and discussed the key initiatives and goals for the sprint. We focused on the implementation of new features such as the User Profile page and CSV export functionality, with an emphasis on refining the user experience. The team also reviewed ongoing refactoring tasks, the integration of the automatic bug detection tool, and the importance of finalizing documentation. We identified areas for improvement, including unit test coverage, and outlined the key tasks needed to meet the sprint’s objectives and prepare for the final project deliverables.

1. ### **New Features Review:**

- User Profile Page: The User Profile page was introduced as a new feature for Sprint 4\. The design has been developed with a focus on user-friendliness and responsiveness. The profile page is intended to give users an easy way to view and manage their personal data. We reviewed the initial progress on this feature, ensuring that it meets the project’s goals for improving user engagement.  
- CSV Export Functionality: The CSV export functionality was also prioritized in this sprint. This feature will allow users to export their data summary in CSV format, making it easier to analyze and share their information. The team discussed the initial design and approach for integrating the export functionality, with a focus on ensuring data accuracy and ease of use.

2. ### **Unit Testing Progress:**

- ### Backend Testing: We identified the need for backend testing focused on verifying the accuracy of user data retrieval, ensuring that the User Profile page displays correct information, and confirming that the CSV export functionality works as expected.

- ### Frontend Testing: Frontend testing will ensure that the User Profile page is displayed correctly on different devices and handles edge cases, such as missing user details. The CSV export functionality will also be tested on the frontend to ensure that it is intuitive and error-free.

  ### The team has committed to expanding unit test coverage throughout the sprint, with a focus on both backend and frontend components.

3. ### **Refactoring and Code Improvements:**

   We discussed ongoing refactoring efforts aimed at improving the readability and maintainability of the codebase. Key refactoring tasks include:  
- Simplifying complex functions to enhance clarity.  
- Reducing duplication across the codebase.  
- Improving the modularity of components for easier testing and extension.  
  These efforts will continue throughout Sprint 4 to ensure the codebase remains clean and efficient.

4. ### **Automatic Bug Detection Tool:**

   The integration of an automatic bug detection tool was reviewed. This tool is designed to scan the codebase for common issues, such as performance bottlenecks and code style violations. We discussed the tool’s current functionality and agreed that it would be further fine-tuned in Sprint 4 to ensure thorough detection across the entire codebase.

5. ### **Documentation:**

   We emphasized the need for completing and refining documentation in Sprint 4, particularly for the frontend folder. Key documentation tasks include:  
- Frontend Documentation: Providing clear guidelines on the structure and usage of the new components, such as the User Profile page and CSV export functionality.  
- Project Report: The group report is being updated to reflect the progress made in Sprint 4, including details of the new features, testing coverage, and refactoring efforts.  
  This will ensure that all documentation is finalized and aligned with the final deliverables.

6. ### **Priorities**

As we continue through Sprint 4, the following tasks were prioritized:

- [ ] **Finalize User Profile and CSV Export Features:** Complete the development and testing of the User Profile page and CSV export functionality, ensuring all features meet the requirements and are fully functional.  
- [ ] **Unit Testing and Acceptance Testing:** Expand the unit testing coverage for both frontend and backend components. Conduct final acceptance tests to ensure all features meet quality standards.  
- [ ] **Documentation Updates:** Continue refining and updating the project documentation, ensuring clarity and completeness.  
- [ ] **Refactor Codebase:** Continue refactoring efforts to improve code maintainability and performance.
