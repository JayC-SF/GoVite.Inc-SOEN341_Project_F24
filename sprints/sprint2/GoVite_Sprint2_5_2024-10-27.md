**Executive summary**  
In this meeting, we reviewed the progress made since our last gathering, noting significant advancements such as the refactoring of the UI for the Dashboard and the design of course displays. We recognized that our achievements in Sprint 1 have set a strong foundation, but acknowledged the need to accelerate the implementation phase in Sprint 2\. Specifically, we focused on building dashboard functionalities to display courses and groups, along with integrating a database to facilitate data management for the courses list and student information. Additionally, we discussed the importance of designing a robust database schema that outlines the relationships between different data entities, which will guide the team's efforts in implementing it within MongoDB. To improve our workflow, we emphasized the necessity for all team members to enhance issue descriptions on the sprint board by following the established template. Finally, we assigned tasks related to pipeline implementation and dashboard design, ensuring that each team member understands their responsibilities and the support needed to successfully implement features related to course display.
