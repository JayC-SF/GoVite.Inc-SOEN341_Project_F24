**Executive summary**  
In this meeting, we conducted a thorough review of Sprint 2 requirements, highlighting our progress on key features such as user authentication, team management, and the basic peer assessment interface. We emphasized the importance of tracking our progress effectively to ensure that we meet our development goals. Discussions centered on setting priorities for upcoming tasks, particularly the implementation of remaining features, including dimension-based assessments and the integration of optional comment boxes for qualitative feedback. We also focused on the development of test cases and the establishment of a continuous integration (CI) pipeline to enhance the reliability of our application. Furthermore, we explored potential new features and enhancements aimed at improving user experience and ensuring that our application remains responsive to user needs, all while maintaining alignment with our overarching project objectives and adapting to any challenges that may arise in future sprints.

1. Sprint 2 Review  
   We conducted a comprehensive review of Sprint 2, focusing on the successful implementation of key features, including user authentication and team management. This review allowed us to evaluate our progress against the initial goals set during Sprint 1, highlighting both our accomplishments and areas that require further attention. By reflecting on our work, we aimed to understand the challenges faced and strategize for overcoming them in the future.

2. Progress Tracking  
   To ensure we remain on track with our project timeline, we agreed to prioritize effective progress tracking methods. Regular check-ins will be implemented, allowing team members to share updates on their tasks and highlight any potential roadblocks. This proactive approach aims to maintain accountability within the team and ensure timely completion of all milestones.

3. Feature Implementation  
   In our discussion about feature implementation, we outlined specific responsibilities for each team member regarding the basic peer assessment interface in Github. By clarifying individual roles, we can ensure a cohesive approach to development and minimize confusion. We also recognized the importance of continuous communication among team members during this implementation phase to facilitate collaboration and address any issues as they arise.

4. Setting Priorities  
   We reached a consensus on the need to establish clear priorities for our upcoming tasks, focusing first on critical features such as dimension-based assessments. By prioritizing tasks in this manner, we aim to streamline our efforts and allocate resources effectively, ensuring that the most important features receive the attention they require.  
     
5. Test Cases and Continuous Integration  
   We highlighted the importance of developing comprehensive test cases for the implemented features to verify functionality and improve reliability. Additionally, we agreed to set up a continuous integration (CI) pipeline, which will allow for automated testing and deployment. This process will not only enhance our workflow but also enable us to quickly identify and address any issues that may arise during development.

6. New Feature Discussions  
   In our discussions about new features, we explored various enhancements that could further align our application with user needs. This ongoing dialogue is crucial for the evolution of our application, as it allows us to gather insights and feedback on what instructors and students find valuable. We emphasized the importance of remaining adaptable and open to new ideas to ensure our project continues to meet its objectives.
